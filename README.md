### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hi, I'm Emily! I've always been fascinated by how numbers can tell hidden stories and drive business decisions.
Right now, I'm diving deep into my [Master of Management Analytics](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/programs/mma) program at McGill University. It's been an amazing ride, sharpening my skills in everything from statistical analysis to machine learning. And guess what? I've been putting these skills to the test on real-world data, with some cool projects you can check out on my GitHub.
